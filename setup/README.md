## Workshop Setup

###  Google Cloud Console Setup

Login to Google Cloud Console with the special workshop credentials:

[https://console.cloud.google.com/home](https://console.cloud.google.com/home)

If you were provided with a Google Cloud Lab username setup the account by:

1 - If you see a top bar with Sign Up for Free Trial - DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THE FREE TRIAL. Click Dismiss since you'll be using a pre-provisioned lab account. If you are doing this on your own account, then you may want the free trial.

2 - Select the only Google Cloud Platform project in the project list. If you don't see a project, let the instructor know!

##  Google Cloud Shell or Local Install

This workshop can either be run all locally using the following setup instructions or it can be run in Google Cloud Shell.

### Local Setup [CLOUD SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)

####  Install Cloud SDK

  `./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh`

#### Initialize Cloud SDK

  `gcloud init`

Login to your account and then choose the goto berlin project back at the command line:

```
  Pick cloud project to use:
    [1] gotober2018-ber-9049
    [2] Create a new project
    Please enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match list
item):  1

```

Configure the default Compute Region and Zone:

```
Do you want to configure a default Compute Region and Zone? (Y/n)?  Y
.....
[16] europe-west4-c
.....
Please enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match list
item):  16

```

#### Verify Cloud SDK

  `gcloud config list`

#### Optional if necesary - manual login to cloud

  `gcloud auth login`

#### Install kubectl

  `gcloud components install kubectl`

If you already have an installation of kubectl in your computer you can skip this step.

#### Windows Setup

If you install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) you get Curl automatically too. There are some advantages:

Git takes care of the PATH setup during installation automatically.
You get the GNU bash, a really powerful shell, in my opinion much better than the native Windows console.
You get many other useful Linux tools like tail, cat, grep, gzip, pdftotext, less, sort, tar, vim and even Perl.

## Optional - Cloud Shell

The entire workshop can also be run from the [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/developer-shell/#how_do_i_get_started), a command line environment running in the Cloud. This Debian-based virtual machine is loaded with all the development tools youâ€™ll need (docker, gcloud, kubectl and others) and offers a persistent 5GB home directory. Open the Google Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon on the top right of the screen:

![Google Cloud Shell Setup](../images/cloud_shell.png)

1. When prompted, click Start Cloud Shell. You should see the shell prompt at the bottom of the window.

2. Check to see if Cloud Shell's Boost mode is Enabled.

3. If not, then enable Boost Mode for Cloud Shell.

Note: When you run gcloud on your own machine, the config settings will be persisted across sessions.  But in Cloud Shell, you will need to set this for every new session / reconnection.


## Get the Workshop Source:

Clone from the current repository, e.g.
